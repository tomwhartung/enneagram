## Open Enneagram of Personality Scales

This is an interactive personality test that uses the Enneagram model of personality.

*Introduction:* The Enneagram is a model of personality in which there are nine personality types, related to each other according to the geometry of the Enneagram figure (pictured right).

The Enneagram is not a model used in psychological research, but is widely promoted in various forms by various persons and organizations for self-help, business management, and spiritual development. The first use of the Enneagram was in the teachings of Oscar Ichazo on spiritual development in the 1950s. In 1980s and 1990s a string of popular self-help books were published that centred on the Enneagram. The OEPS was developed by this website as an open source assessment to match takers to the most common conceptions of the nine types. Read its documentation here.

*Participation:* This test is free to take and provided for educational use only. It should not be used as psychological advice of any kind and comes without any guarantee of accuracy or fitness for any particular purpose.
