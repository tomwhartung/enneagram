**Continuing the assessment of my FIRST TRY at reverse-engineering the open source OEPS Enneagram test.**

## Checking the Book

Looking at the 3 items for which my first guess, in `items-key-1-first_try.md`:

1. Did NOT match my "educated guess" based on some of the site's js source code, saved in `items-key-javascript_code.md`
   - I.e., items marked with "Bzzt!"
2. Did NOT immediately seem "reasonable for this item"

## Summary:

- 20 **MATCHES**
  - My first guess matches my js-informed "educated guess"
- 16 **No match - bzzt:**
  - My first guess does NOT match my js-informed "educated guess"
  - 13 are reasonable
  - 3 could be reasonable

## Checking the "could be reasonable" items

Looking at the *Summary of Type Discriminators* section on pp 56-68 of *The Essential Enneagram* book by David Daniels and Virginia Price.

### Item #4

4. I have a hard time showing emotions.

My guess: 3=Achiever,Performer versus group it is in: 5=Investigator,Observer

- Both types "can be oriented toward tasks [and] objectivity" (p. 61), so confusion is undertandable.
- A discriminating factor is sporadic activity (5=Observer) versus continuous activity (3=Performer).

The discriminating factor is irrelevant to this question, so the "educated guesses" based on the javascript look good!

### Item #28

28. I always try to break the tension with a good joke.

7 could be reasonable for this item...

My guess: 9=Peacemaker,Mediator versus group it is in: 7=Enthusiast,Epicure

- Both types "seek comfort" and "want to be liked and get along with others (p. 68), so confusion is undertandable.
- A discriminating factor is a "frenetic" and faster pace (7=Epicure) versus a "more even-tempered" and slower pace (9=Mediator).

The discriminating factor is irrelevant to this question, so the "educated guesses" based on the javascript look good!

### Item #29

29. Fear of being taken advantage of keeps me from being more trusting.

My guess: 8=Challenger,Protector versus group it is in: 6=Loyalist,Loyal Skeptic

- Both types "share a view of the world as unfriendly and untrustworthy" (p. 67).
- A discriminating factor is spontaneity: 6=Loyal Skeptics "usually have moments of fear or hesitation" while 8=Protectors "take action without hesitation" (p. 67).

The discriminating factor is irrelevant to this question, so the "educated guesses" based on the javascript look good!
