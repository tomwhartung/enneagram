About the combo questionnaires, that contain items from the first three questionnaires in `..` , the directory immediately above this one.

## The Idea

Have a *best combo* questionnaire and a *combo questionnaire with extra items.*

- Make one 180-item questionnaire with the best 20 items for each type
  - 4 "oeps" items from `../1-open_enneagram_of_personality_scales`
  - 8 "teme" items from `../2-the_enneagram_made_easy`
  - 8 "twote" items from `../3-the_wisdom_of_the_enneagram`
- Make another 225-item questionnaire with all 25 items for each type
  - 4 "oeps" items from `../1-open_enneagram_of_personality_scales`
  - 9 "teme" items from `../2-the_enneagram_made_easy`
  - 12 "twote" items from `../3-the_wisdom_of_the_enneagram`

The idea is to:

- Usually use the 180-item questionnaire
- Use the 225-item questionnaire when there is a tie or the results do not seem to make sense in some way

## Questionnaires

Spreadsheets containing the questionnaires are in this directory, in files named:

- `combo-180_items-best.ods` and
- `combo-225_items-with_extras.ods`

## Directories

- `items`
  - Lists of items from the other three questionnaires
- `work_area`
  - Contains intermediary versions of the spreadsheets, beginning with the lists of items and ending with the questionnaires
