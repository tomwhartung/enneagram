About the combo questionnaires, that contain items from the first three questionnaires in `..` , the directory immediately above this one.

## The Idea

- Make one 180-item questionnaire with the best 20 items for each type
- Make another 225-item questionnaire with all 25 items for each type

The idea is to:

- Usually use the 180-item questionnaire
- Use the 225-item questionnaire when there is a tie or the results do not seem to make sense in some way

## Questionnaires

Spreadsheets containing the questionnaires are in files named:

- `combo-180_items.ods` and
- `combo-225_items.ods`

in this directory.

## Directories

- `items`
  - Lists of items from the other three questionnaires
- `work_area`
  - Contains intermediary versions of the spreadsheets, beginning with the lists of items and ending with the questionnaires
