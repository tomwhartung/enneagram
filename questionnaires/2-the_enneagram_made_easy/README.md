About the questionnaire inspired by the book *The Enneagram Made Easy* by Renee Baron and Elizabeth Wagele, 1994

## Questionnaire

A spreadsheet containing the questionnaire is in this directory, in a file named:

- `teme-81_items.ods`

## Directories

- `items`
  - List of items paraphrased from the *Personality Inventory* section for each type in the book
  - I was able to paraphrase 9-10 items from each group of 20 sentences in each of these chapters
- `work_area`
  - Contains intermediary versions of the spreadsheet beginning with the list of paraphrased items and ending with the questionnaire
